Gosh, talk about a blast from the past!

I'm glad you enjoyed the game and I hope I didn't screw up your grades too
badly.  I originally wrote it for the Exidy Sorcerer (a Z80 based system 
that didn't last very long.)  The first version took up more memory than 
the demo unit at New Dimensions In Computing (NDIC) had.  I eventually 
crammed it down into 16K and ported it to the Apple ][ and TRS-80. 
After a sale to Kilobaud software fell through, I sent it off to
Recreational Computing.

In case you were wondering about the strange comment and the weird machine
language call - Exidy bought the cheap version of Microsoft's Basic 
interpreter and it had no RANDOMIZE command.  I created one and tucked it 
into the comment.  That, more than anything else, caused people the most 
headaches in converting it.

Anyway, it is nice to see people enjoyed it.

Joe Power
