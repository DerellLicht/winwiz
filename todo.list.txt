ToDo list
=========

- Update player icon;
  after "you see yourself turn into a xxx", player should be drawn with icon for xxx ...
  
- Vendor dialog: Attributes buttons should be disabled, 
  if not enough gold to use them
  
  Also, Sell Gems should be disabled if no gems are available (or selected)  

- Impatient vendors is not yet implemented

- Implement some way to track possessions of monsters/vendors,
  so if we trade/bribe gems to them, we can get them back later.
